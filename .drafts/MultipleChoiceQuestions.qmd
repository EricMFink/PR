1. Sonny Guest is an attorney who wishes to advertise using the following slogans: “When you need a lawyer, save money by seeing Sonny" and “For your legal needs, Guest is the best!" What advice would you give Sonny about the propriety of these advertisements under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct? 

- Sonny has two problems. Under Rule 7.1, he may not advertise in any way that is false and misleading. The statement that you will "save money" by hiring him is a comparison of the cost of his services with the competition. Similarly, to say “Guest is the best" is a comparison of the quality of his services with the services of other lawyers. The risk is that these statements may be construed to have been presented with sufficient specificity as to cause a reasonable person to believe that they can be substantiated. If the statements do give rise to that reasonable belief, and they cannot be substantiated, they are misleading under Rule 7.1. See Comment [3] to Rule 7.1. 

2. Hattie Dougherty is an attorney who specializes in representing plaintiffs in accidents involving all-terrain vehicles. She has won several huge verdicts that have garnered headlines such as “Hattie Wins $10 million Verdict from Local Jury" and “Dougherty Does it Again: ATV Manufacturer Socked for $15.2 million." Hattie would like to include a "montage" of these headlines as the background for her new television advertisements. What advice would you give Hattie about the propriety of this idea under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct? 

-  Hattie's problem is that using the headlines, even if they are truthful, may create an unjustified expectation in the minds of potential clients that Hattie can secure similar results for them. That unjustified expectation would mean that the advertisement would be misleading under Rule 7.1. See Comment 3 to Rule 7.1. If Hattie wants to use the headlines, she will need to include a disclaimer, for example, that she cannot necessarily obtain results like the results depicted or that all cases must be evaluated on their own merits.

3. Rita McCue is an attorney who specializes in elder law. She would like to increase her volume of business by conducting a series of “educational seminars" around her state through the auspices of local senior citizen centers. She is hoping that many of the attendees will become clients. As she embarks on his tour of seminars, what ethical advice would you give Rita? 

- Rita needs to be particularly careful about in-person solicitation of clients. Although nothing in the Rules of Professional Conduct forbids a lawyer from educating the public about legal issues, this plan will put Rita face-to-face with people she hopes will become clients. Under Rule 7.3, she may not solicit employment from them unless they are lawyers or Rita has a previous professional, family, or close personal relationship with them. Rule 7.3(a). Although Rita may certainly respond to requests for assistance from attendees who initiate contact with her, she may not initiate the relationship by soliciting employment.

The partner has instructed Attorney not to inform the court at the ex parte hearing of certain material facts that harm their client's case. Under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, may Attorney follow the partner's instructions?

If it turns out that the claims were frivolous, would Associate be subject to discipline? Would Applebaum be subject to discipline?

- Rule 5.7?

8. Schweikart is an attorney in a case about mortgage fraud. He learns that his opposing counsel assisted the opposing party in the fraud. Schweikart would like to threaten to reveal that information to the bar during negotiations to resolve the case.

9. Upon graduating law school, Dewey is hired by the law firm of Applebaum & Becker, located in the city of Metropolis. Applebaum, a partner at the firm, asks Dewey to sign an employment contract.

- Is Dewey subject to discipline if he signs the contract?
