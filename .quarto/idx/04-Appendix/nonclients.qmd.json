Bluebird has been sued for employment discrimination by a woman who has been using her work e-mail account to send questions about the suit to and receive answers from her attorney. Under Bluebird's written company policy, Bluebird has the right to inspect and copy any messages sent or received on Bluebird e-mail accounts.

The e-mail message attaches a photo copied from the husband's Facebook account in which the husband appears to be smoking marijuana. The friend attaches another in which the husband appears to be dancing nude on a beach with several other people in a similar state of undress.

Attorney knows that the claim will not be dischargeable in bankruptcy as long as the claimant files a claim by the deadline.

Attorney tells this young lawyer that if she files a claim it will just be discharged under bankruptcy law.

Attorney has several deals underway with prospective investors. Attorney has just learned that the client has been perpetrating an ongoing fraud with these deals.

Attorney must immediately withdraw from the representation and may have to give notice of his withdrawal to the investors involved in the ongoing deals.\n\n### Question 11\n\nAttorney is representing a client in a civil case involving an alleged breach of contract. A crucial issue in the case will be what the parties intended by certain provisions in their complicated contract. In discovery, Attorney has received an electronic version of the contract from her adversary's attorney. Attorney is informed that he can access certain “meta-data\" in that contract, which may include revisions and comments that were made by the opposing party (and not its counsel) during the negotiations over the contract. May Attorney take steps to access this \"meta-data,” consistent with his obligations under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct? \n\n### Question 12\n\nAttorney represents the wife in a divorce case. The husband is represented by counsel, Attorney's client is tired of paying hefty legal bills and tired of seeing the marital estate dissipated by the similarly hefty legal bills that her husband is paying. Attorney wants to suggest to her client that the client approach the husband directly about resolving all issues by agreement. Attorney could coach her client on how to approach the husband and how best to negotiate a good deal. Is Attorney's plan consistent with her responsibilities under the Model Rules of Professional Conduct? \n\n### Question 13\n\n\nAttorney is in the midst of trying to negotiate the settlement of a civil claim with the assistance of a mediator. The mediator, who is not a judge, is conducting the settlement negotiations in a \"caucus” format, and is shuttling back and forth between the parties. Ordinarily, Attorney would feel free in a negotiation to bluff about her settlement authority by telling the plaintiff's counsel that she cannot exceed a certain payment, even if her authority is actually for a greater amount. May Attorney engage in this tactic in a caucused mediation?
