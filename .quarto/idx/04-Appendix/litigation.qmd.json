Yes, unless the jury could make its own identification of the defendant from the videotape.\n\nb. Yes, because this information tended to negate the defendant's guilt.\n\nc. No, because the defendant's counsel made no pretrial discovery request to obtain this information.\n\nd. No, unless it is likely that the jury would have acquitted the defendant had it known the witness first identified someone else.\n\n### Question 4\n\nFive years ago, Defendant was convicted of armed robbery in Guilford County and sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years. Two years ago, Lawyer was elected District Attorney for Guilford County. Last week, Lawyer received convincing evidence indicating that Defendant was wrongfully convicted. Lawyer was in private practice at the time of Defendant's trial and convition and played no role in the case. \n\nWhat are Lawyer's ethical obligations?\n\n### Question 5\n\nTen years ago, Prosecutor obtained the conviction of Defendant for murder.
