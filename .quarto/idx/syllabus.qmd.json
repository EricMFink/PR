Upon successfully completing the course, students should be familiar with the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct and other sources of law governing the legal profession, and be able to apply these rules to issues that arise in legal practice. The course will also help prepare students for the [Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE)](https://www.ncbex.org/exams/mpre/), but will not cover all of the topics tested on that exam. \n\n## Materials {.unnumbered}\n\n### Required  {.unnumbered}\n\nProfessional Responsibility: An Open-Source Casebook (v.4.1 2025). Available on the course website: [[emfink.net/PR](https://www.emfink.net/PR/)]{.mono-font}.\n\n### Suggested  {.unnumbered}\n\nGrace M. Giesel, [Mastering Professional Responsibility](https://cap-press.com/books/isbn/9781611636208/Mastering-Professional-Responsibility-Second-Edition) (2d ed., Carolina Academic Press 2015). \n\n## Policies {.unnumbered}\n\n### Grading {.unnumbered}\n\nYour grade will be based on a final examination consisting of multiple choice questions, similar in format to the [Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE)](https://www.ncbex.org/exams/mpre). You will receive a copy of the Rules of Professional Conduct to use during the exam, which will otherwise be closed-book/closed-notes. The exam will take place during the Fall exam period (date and time TBA)\n\n### Attendance {.unnumbered}\n\nElon Law School has adopted the following attendance policy for all courses:\n\n> The Law School administers a policy that a student maintain regular and punctual class attendance in all courses in which the student is registered, including externships, clinical courses, or simulation courses. Faculty members will give students written notice of their attendance policies before or during the first week of class. These policies may include, but are not limited to: treating late arrivals, early departures, and/or lack of preparation as absences; imposing grade or point reductions for absences, including assigning a failing grade or involuntarily withdrawing a student from the class; and any other policies that a professor deems appropriate to create a rigorous and professional classroom environment.\n> \n> In case of illness or emergency, students may contact the Office of Student and Professional Life, which will then notify the student's instructors. A student may notify the faculty member directly of a planned absence and should refer to individual faculty members regarding any policy that may apply. In the case of prolonged illness or incapacity, the student should contact the [Office of Student Life](https://www.elon.edu/u/law/students/).\n\nYou should let me know (in advance if feasible) if you are unable to attend class, will arrive late, or must leave early. I do not require an explanation of the reason, nor do I require a doctor's note or other documentation.\n\n### Disability Accommodations {.unnumbered}\n\nFor disability accommodation requests, contact the [Elon Disability Services Office](https://www.elon.edu/u/academics/koenigsberger-learning-center/disabilities-resources/homepage/graduate-student-resources/).\n\n### Honor Code {.unnumbered}\n\nThe Law School [honor code](https://www.elon.edu/u/law/students/honor-code/) applies to all activities related to your law school study, including conduct during class and examinations.\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Schedule & Reading Assignments {.unnumbered}\n\n(_Note:_ This class will not meet on Sept. 24)\n\n### 1.
